# EldenOS – Design Notes

## Why I'm Building It
- Learn everything under the hood of a computer
- Explore how systems are actually built from scratch
- Eventually replace the whole software stack with my own tools

## Core Principles
- Simplicity first: start small and transparent
- Minimal abstractions early on
- Total control of everything — memory, video, input, etc.
- Modular architecture (bootloader → kernel → drivers → apps)

## Language & Toolchain
- Starting in Assembly and C
- Will eventually add my own language
- Tooling: NASM, QEMU, Git, Obsidian

## Near-Term Focus
- Understand boot process byte-by-byte
- Learn VGA graphics and display text/pixels
- Build a keyboard input loop
